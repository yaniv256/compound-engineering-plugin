# Compound Engineering

[![Build Status](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

AI skills that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Philosophy

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier -- not harder.**

Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. Every bug fix leaves behind a little more local knowledge that someone has to rediscover later. The codebase gets larger, the context gets harder to hold, and the next change becomes slower.

Compound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:

- Plan thoroughly before writing code with `/ce-brainstorm` and `/ce-plan` using one readiness-based plan artifact
- Review to catch issues and calibrate judgment with `/ce-code-review` and `/ce-doc-review`
- Codify knowledge so it is reusable with `/ce-compound`
- Keep quality high so future changes are easy

The point is not ceremony. The point is leverage. A good brainstorm makes the plan sharper. A good plan makes execution smaller. A good review catches the pattern, not just the bug. A good compound note means the next agent does not have to learn the same lesson from scratch.

## Workflow

The core loop is six steps: **brainstorm** the requirements, **plan** the implementation, **work** through the plan, **simplify** what you wrote, **review** the result, then **compound** the learning -- and repeat with better context.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/ce-brainstorm` | Interactive Q&A to think through a feature or problem and write a requirements-only unified plan before planning |
| `/ce-plan` | Enrich feature ideas or requirements-only plans into implementation-ready plans |
| `/ce-work` | Execute implementation-ready plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| `/ce-simplify-code` | Refine the freshly written code for clarity and reuse before review |
| `/ce-code-review` | Multi-agent review against the plan before merging |
| `/ce-compound` | Capture the learning into `docs/solutions/` so the next loop starts smarter |

Each cycle compounds: `/ce-compound` writes learnings that the next `/ce-brainstorm` and `/ce-plan` read as grounding -- brainstorms sharpen plans, plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented. That return arrow is the whole point.

### Additional skills

These sit around the loop or get reached for on demand -- not every cycle needs them.

| Skill | When to reach for it |
|-------|---------|
| `/ce-ideate` | *Before the loop*, when you don't yet know what to build -- generates and critically ranks grounded ideas, then routes the strongest one into `/ce-brainstorm` |
| `/ce-strategy` | *Upstream anchor* -- creates and maintains `STRATEGY.md`, read as grounding by ideate, brainstorm, and plan so strategy choices flow into every feature |
| `/ce-product-pulse` | *Outer loop* -- a time-windowed report on what users actually experienced (usage, performance, errors), saved to `docs/pulse-reports/`; its follow-ups feed back into ideation and brainstorming |
| `/ce-debug` | *Instead of brainstorm -> plan -> work* when the input is a bug rather than a feature -- reproduce, trace the causal chain to root cause, then fix |

For the full catalog and how each skill chains together, see [docs/skills](docs/skills/README.md). The complete inventory is [below](#full-skill-inventory).

## Quick Example

**Finding a direction** -- when you don't have a specific idea yet, ideate first, then carry the strongest survivor into the loop:

```text
/ce-ideate new drawing tools
/ce-ideate surprise me
/ce-ideate github issues   # ground ideas in your open issues instead of a prompt
```

`/ce-ideate` does the homework first (codebase, past learnings, prior art on the web, optionally your issue tracker), then hands you a ranked set of grounded candidates to take into `/ce-brainstorm`.

**Standard feature loop** -- turn a rough idea into shipped, reviewed code:

```text
/ce-brainstorm make background job retries safer
/ce-plan
/ce-work
/ce-simplify-code
/ce-code-review
/ce-compound
```

**Simplifying code** -- use it after fresh implementation work, or point it at code that keeps slowing changes down:

```text
/ce-simplify-code
/ce-simplify-code simplify the code in my most-churned file
```

The first pass tightens recent branch changes before review. The targeted pass is useful when one file keeps absorbing unrelated fixes, follow-ups, or merge conflicts.

**Debugging a bug** -- when you start from broken behavior instead of a feature:

```text
/ce-debug the checkout webhook sometimes creates duplicate invoices
/ce-code-review
/ce-compound
```

**Autonomous** -- hand off a feature and let the agent run the whole pipeline:

```text
/ce-brainstorm describe the feature
/lfg
```

`/lfg` runs the loop hands-off: it plans, works through the plan, simplifies, runs code review and applies the fixes, runs browser tests, commits, pushes, opens a PR, then watches CI and repairs failures until it's green. Start it after `/ce-brainstorm` so it plans against real requirements rather than a one-line prompt. It's the autopilot version of the standard loop -- neat when you want to step away and come back to an open, green PR.

## Getting Started

After installing, run `/ce-setup` in any project. It checks repo-local config, reports optional tool capabilities, and helps keep machine-local CE settings safely gitignored.

The `compound-engineering` plugin currently ships 26 skills and 0 standalone agents. Specialist review, research, and workflow behavior lives inside the owning skills as skill-local prompt assets.

## Install

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin install compound-engineering
```

> **Already have Compound Engineering installed?** Compound Engineering moved to a root-native layout. You must refresh the marketplace *before* updating — see [Existing Installs](#existing-installs). Running `/plugin update` alone keeps you on the old version.

### Cursor

In Cursor Agent chat, install from the plugin marketplace:

```text
/add-plugin compound-engineering
```

Or search for "compound engineering" in the plugin marketplace.

### Codex App

Compound Engineering is not listed in Codex's built-in plugin marketplace yet. Add it as a custom marketplace:

1. In the Codex app, open **Plugins** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Add** / **Add plugin marketplace**.
3. Enter:

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Source | `EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin` |
   | Git ref | `main` |
   | Sparse paths | leave blank |

4. Click **Add marketplace**.
5. Select **Compound Engineering**, install **compound-engineering**, then restart Codex.

The Codex app install is self-contained for Compound Engineering. Specialist reviewer and research behavior lives inside the skills as local prompt assets; no separate custom-agent install step is required.

### Codex CLI

Register the marketplace, then install the plugin.

1. **Register the marketplace with Codex:**

   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
   ```

2. **Install the plugin:**

   ```bash
   codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
   ```

   You can also launch `codex`, run `/plugins`, find the **Compound Engineering** marketplace, select the **compound-engineering** plugin, and choose **Install**. Restart Codex after install completes.

The native Codex plugin install is self-contained for Compound Engineering. Specialist reviewer and research behavior lives inside the skills as local prompt assets; no separate custom-agent install step is required.

For a non-default Codex profile, run every Codex-related step against the same `CODEX_HOME`. This example installs CE into a `work` profile:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex/profiles/work" codex plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex/profiles/work" codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

The marketplace step only makes the plugin available; the plugin install is what activates the native CE skills for that profile.

### Kimi Code CLI

Kimi Code CLI can install Compound Engineering directly from this repository because the repo ships a native `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` manifest:

```text
/plugins install https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

You can also browse it through Kimi's custom marketplace flow:

```text
/plugins marketplace https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/main/.kimi-plugin/marketplace.json
```

After installing or updating, run `/reload` or start a new Kimi session so the plugin skills are loaded.

### GitHub Copilot

For **VS Code Copilot Agent Plugins**:

1. Run `Chat: Install Plugin from Source` from the VS Code command palette
2. Use `EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin` for the repo
3. Select `compound-engineering` when VS Code shows the plugins in this repository

For **Copilot CLI**, use:

Inside Copilot CLI:

```text
/plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

From a shell with the `copilot` binary:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
copilot plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

Copilot CLI reads the existing Claude-compatible plugin manifests, so no separate Bun install step is needed.

### Factory Droid

From a shell with the `droid` binary:

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
droid plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

Droid uses `plugin@marketplace` plugin IDs; here `compound-engineering` is the plugin and `compound-engineering-plugin` is the marketplace name. Droid installs the existing Claude Code-compatible plugin and translates the format automatically, so no Bun install step is needed.

### Qwen Code

```bash
qwen extensions install EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin:compound-engineering
```

Qwen Code installs Claude Code-compatible plugins directly from GitHub and converts the plugin format during install, so no Bun install step is needed.

### OpenCode

Add Compound Engineering to the `plugin` array in your global or project `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["compound-engineering@git+https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing the config. The OpenCode plugin registers the Compound Engineering skills directory directly; no Bun installer or generated skill copy is required. See [`.opencode/INSTALL.md`](.opencode/INSTALL.md) for pinning examples.

### Pi

Install Compound Engineering as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
```

Required companion for CE workflows that dispatch reviewer, research, or implementation subagents:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents
```

Recommended companion for richer blocking questions:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ask-user
```

### Antigravity CLI (`agy`)

Google has replaced the consumer Gemini CLI with [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google) (`agy`), which still runs on Gemini models. Unlike Gemini CLI, `agy` installs plugins from a **local checkout** (not a repository URL), so clone this repository and install the bundled `.agy` plugin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
agy plugin install ./compound-engineering-plugin/.agy
```

`agy` also loads `GEMINI.md` workspace context from the checkout.

### Existing Installs

Compound Engineering moved to a root-native, skills-only layout. An existing marketplace install keeps a **cached** marketplace snapshot that still points at the old `plugins/compound-engineering` path, so updating the plugin on its own reads that stale snapshot and leaves you on the previous version. Refresh the cached marketplace **first**, then update the plugin — order matters.

**Claude Code**

```text
/plugin marketplace update compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin update compound-engineering
```

**Codex CLI**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade compound-engineering-plugin
codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

There is no `codex plugin update`; re-running `add` reinstalls from the refreshed snapshot. For a non-default profile, run both commands against the same `CODEX_HOME`.

**Codex App**

Refresh the marketplace from the **Plugins** panel (remove and re-add the `EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin` marketplace if there is no refresh control), then reinstall **compound-engineering** and restart Codex.

If you configured a host with a direct path or sparse path under `plugins/compound-engineering`, edit or reinstall that source so it points at the repository root with no sparse path.

If a previous Bun-installed copy is still shadowing native plugin skills, run the current cleanup command from a checkout of this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git /tmp/compound-engineering-plugin-cleanup
cd /tmp/compound-engineering-plugin-cleanup
bun install
bun run cleanup --target all
```

---

## Local Development

```bash
bun install
bun test
bun run release:validate
```

### From your local checkout

For active development, load this checkout directly in the harness you want to test.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir "$PWD"
```

**Codex App**

In the app's **Add plugin marketplace** form, use this checkout as the source:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `/path/to/compound-engineering-plugin` |
| Git ref | current branch, or leave blank for a local folder |
| Sparse paths | leave blank |

**Codex CLI**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD"
codex plugin add compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin
```

Use a separate `CODEX_HOME` when you want to keep local testing isolated from your normal Codex profile. The Codex marketplace entry points at the public Git plugin source so root-shaped plugin repos install correctly; use a temporary marketplace catalog with a `source.url` plus `ref` when testing unpublished plugin-content changes end to end.

**Kimi Code CLI**

Inside Kimi Code CLI:

```text
/plugins install /path/to/compound-engineering-plugin
```

To test the local marketplace catalog instead, pass the catalog path:

```text
/plugins marketplace /path/to/compound-engineering-plugin/.kimi-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**OpenCode**

```json
{
  "plugin": ["/path/to/compound-engineering-plugin"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing `opencode.json`.

**Pi**

```bash
pi -e "$PWD"
```

**Antigravity CLI (`agy`)**

```bash
agy plugin install "$PWD/.agy"
```

`agy` installs the bundled `.agy` plugin directory from your checkout and loads `GEMINI.md` workspace context.

## Limitations

OpenCode and Pi use native package/plugin loading from this repository. The Bun CLI remains for repository development and converter maintenance, not normal installation.

Release versions are owned by release automation. Routine feature PRs should not hand-bump plugin or marketplace manifest versions.

## FAQ

### Do I need Bun to install Compound Engineering?

No. Bun is only needed for repo development tasks and converter maintenance.

### Where do I see all available skills?

The skill inventory is in this README. Each skill's authoritative runtime spec lives in `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.

### Where is release history?

GitHub Releases are the canonical release-notes surface. The root [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) points to that history.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Issues, bug reports, and pull requests all help make this better, and we genuinely appreciate them — bug reports especially.

A note on what to expect: Compound Engineering is opinionated by design. It's maintained by [@kieranklaassen](https://github.com/kieranklaassen) and [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow), and its direction reflects a specific point of view about how AI-assisted engineering should work. So while we welcome help, we can't promise to accept every change — some proposals won't fit that vision even when they're good ideas on their own.

Open an issue or send a PR, and we'll fold in what moves the plugin in the right direction. We just want to be upfront that not everything will land.
