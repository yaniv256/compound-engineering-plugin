/**
 * Convention-enforcement tests for skill content, encoding the repo-root
 * AGENTS.md rules "File References in Skills" and "Platform-Specific
 * Variables in Skills", plus the Anthropic skill-spec frontmatter limits.
 *
 * Skill directories are enumerated dynamically under plugins/<plugin>/skills/
 * so new skills (and new plugins) are auto-covered.
 *
 * Rule groups:
 *
 * 1. SELF-CONTAINMENT (AGENTS.md "File References in Skills"): a skill must
 *    not reference files outside its own directory tree. Detection policy —
 *    designed to avoid false positives on documentation examples:
 *      - Fenced code blocks are stripped before scanning. Teaching samples,
 *        message templates, and anti-pattern demos live in fences (e.g.,
 *        screenshot markdown like `![Before](url-1)`), and fences are where
 *        skills quote code they are ABOUT rather than files they USE. This
 *        fence policy is Rule-1-specific — Rule 2 deliberately differs (see
 *        below): self-containment looks for ESCAPING references, which in
 *        fences are overwhelmingly quoted anti-patterns, while reference
 *        integrity looks for LOCAL paths, which in fences are overwhelmingly
 *        real script invocations.
 *      - Markdown link/image targets are treated as real references. A target
 *        is a violation when it is absolute (`/...`, `~/...`) or when it
 *        resolves outside the skill directory under BOTH file-relative and
 *        skill-root-relative anchoring (a `../scripts/x` link from
 *        `references/` resolves inside the skill and is allowed).
 *      - Prose/backtick mentions of installed-plugin paths
 *        (`~/.claude/plugins/...`) are flagged — AGENTS.md names this as a
 *        broken pattern. Files whose PURPOSE is reading that machine state
 *        are exempted below with written reasons.
 *      - Bare absolute paths in prose are NOT flagged: skills legitimately
 *        discuss `/tmp` scratch conventions and quote `/Users/...` as
 *        anti-pattern examples (ce-plan, ce-compound, ce-ideate).
 *
 * 2. REFERENCE INTEGRITY (AGENTS.md "File References in Skills"): every
 *    skill-local path mentioned in a skill's markdown must exist on disk
 *    INSIDE the skill directory. Candidates are (a) relative markdown link
 *    targets outside fences, (b) `references/...`, `scripts/...`, or
 *    `assets/...` path tokens inside backtick code spans — whether the span
 *    IS the path (`scripts/run.sh`) or embeds it in a command
 *    (`bash scripts/run.sh ARG`, `python3 scripts/foo.py <arg>`), so a
 *    deleted or renamed script is caught even when mentioned only as an
 *    executable command — (c) the same path tokens inside FENCED code
 *    blocks, and (d) `@`-include targets in prose (`@./references/x.md` —
 *    inlined at load time, so a deleted target breaks the skill at load).
 *    For (b) and (c), tokens are unwrapped before the shape gate:
 *    surrounding quotes and a platform-variable prefix (`${VAR}/`,
 *    `${VAR:-default}/`, `$VAR/`) are stripped, so the repo's documented
 *    cross-platform invocation style
 *    (`bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/x.sh"` — AGENTS.md
 *    "Platform-Specific Variables in Skills") yields `scripts/x.sh` as a
 *    candidate; the variable prefix means "skill-root-relative" by that
 *    convention, so skill-root anchoring is correct for the remainder.
 *    Deliberately NOT candidates (per a mechanical audit of every
 *    references/-, scripts/-, assets/-mentioning line across all skills):
 *    bare path tokens in prose with no backticks, link, or `@` prefix —
 *    unmarked prose is where hypothetical teaching examples live, and the
 *    only real instances (advisory `references/yaml-schema.md` pointers in
 *    HTML comments inside ce-compound's and ce-compound-refresh's asset
 *    templates) sit in templates that are instantiated OUTSIDE the skill,
 *    where the path is context for a future reader, not a runtime
 *    dependency — and directory-only mentions (`references/` with no
 *    filename), which name no file to check.
 *    (c) is where this rule's fence policy deliberately diverges
 *    from Rule 1: fenced bash blocks are where skills put their REAL bundled
 *    script invocations (for example, `bash scripts/session-history/extract-metadata.py`),
 *    so stripping fences here would let a deleted or renamed script pass CI
 *    while the skill fails at runtime. Markdown-link syntax inside fences is
 *    still NOT a candidate — fenced `[text](references/x.md)` is teaching
 *    material, and its parentheses/brackets fail the bare-token shape — and
 *    backticks within fenced lines act as token separators so inline-code
 *    path mentions in fenced pseudocode tokenize cleanly. A candidate passes
 *    when it resolves
 *    inside the skill directory (anchored at the skill root or at the
 *    containing file's directory) AND exists there. Resolution is contained
 *    BEFORE any existence check: a `..` candidate that escapes the skill is
 *    a violation even when the target exists in a sibling skill — existence
 *    elsewhere is exactly what makes it a cross-skill reference. Targets
 *    containing template placeholder characters (`<`, `>`, `*`, `{`, `$`)
 *    are skipped.
 *
 * 3. FRONTMATTER LIMITS (Anthropic skill spec — hard constraints, with no
 *    exemption lists because exceeding them breaks real behavior):
 *      - frontmatter description <= 1024 chars (some harnesses reject longer
 *        descriptions — also enforced in tests/frontmatter.test.ts).
 *      - frontmatter name <= 64 chars.
 *    Deliberately NOT gated here: the 500-line SKILL.md body guidance and any
 *    byte cap on skill bodies. The line guidance is advice, not a constraint —
 *    several skills in this plugin are large by design, and gating guidance
 *    would tax every deliberately-large skill with exemption-list ceremony.
 *    The "8KB Codex body cap" that circulates in ecosystem lint tooling turned
 *    out to be folklore: Codex's real limit is an ~8,000-character budget on
 *    the injected skills metadata LIST, while full SKILL.md bodies are read
 *    from disk on demand (see the note in tests/real-plugin-conversion.test.ts).
 *
 * 4. PLATFORM-VARIABLE FALLBACK (AGENTS.md "Platform-Specific Variables in
 *    Skills"): skill markdown using harness variables (${CLAUDE_*},
 *    ${CODEX_*}) must degrade gracefully. Mechanically graceful forms pass
 *    outright: a shell default (`${VAR:-...}`) or an existence guard
 *    (`[ -n "$VAR" ]` / `[ -z "$VAR" ]` / `[ -f "${VAR}/path" ]`). EXCEPTION:
 *    a skill-directory var (CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR / CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, see
 *    SKILL_DIR_VARS) used to locate a bundled file is NOT made graceful by a
 *    `${VAR:-.}` default — that default resolves to the project CWD and
 *    silently misses the bundled script on non-Claude targets (issue #943);
 *    it must use an existence guard or be acknowledged. Any other use must be
 *    explicitly acknowledged in PLATFORM_VAR_ACKNOWLEDGED with a written
 *    reason naming the prose fallback (the AGENTS.md pre-resolution pattern).
 *    An earlier
 *    revision tried to verify the fallback PROSE itself, via a fallback
 *    keyword list and a line window — that graded English with regexes and
 *    failed legitimate rewordings, so the editorial judgment now lives in
 *    the registry: exact matching, immune to prose rewording, vetted by a
 *    reviewer when the entry is added, kept honest by a stale-entry check.
 *    Credential-style env vars (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY) are out of scope —
 *    they are API requirements, not harness variables.
 *
 * Each rule's scanning helpers are unit-tested with in-file fixtures at the
 * bottom of this file (mutation-resistance layer, matching the house style
 * of tests/skill-shell-safety.test.ts).
