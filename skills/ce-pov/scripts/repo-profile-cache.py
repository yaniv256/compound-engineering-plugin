"""Shared repo-grounding project-profile cache: deterministic get/put.

This helper owns the *deterministic* cache I/O for the question-agnostic
project profile that repo-grounding skills reuse. The non-deterministic
derivation (reading manifests, summarizing conventions) is done by the
`repo-profiler` persona only on a miss — never here.

Usage:
    python3 repo-profile-cache.py get
    python3 repo-profile-cache.py put <profile-json-file>

`get` prints exactly one of:
    HIT\\n<profile-json>     a valid entry exists for the current repo state;
                            the profile JSON follows on subsequent lines
    MISS\\n<write-path>      git repo, no valid entry — caller derives the
                            profile and calls `put <write-path-or-any-file>`
    NO-CACHE                no git repo or no writable cache — caller derives
                            the profile fresh and skips `put`

`put <file>` reads the profile JSON from <file>, wraps it with a validity
stamp, and writes it atomically to the computed cache path. Prints the path
on success, `NO-CACHE` when the repo/cache is unavailable.

Cache path:
    /tmp/compound-engineering-<uid>/repo-profile/<root-sha>/<head-sha>.json
  root-sha = lexicographically-first `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`
             (deterministic even for multi-root histories) — the repo identity,
             shared across worktrees and clones.
  head-sha = `git rev-parse HEAD` — the working state.

Validity (HIT) requires ALL of:
  - the cache file exists and parses as JSON,
  - stored `head_sha` == current HEAD,
  - stored `profile_schema_version` == PROFILE_SCHEMA_VERSION,
  - no profile-input path is dirty or newly-added per `git status --porcelain`
    (the schema-derived superset in `is_profile_input`, which also catches
    untracked `??` files — a newly-added manifest or AGENTS.md must invalidate).

Cardinal rule: this cache is an optimization, never a correctness dependency.
Every failure mode (not a git repo, unreadable/malformed cache, no writable
/tmp, git errors) degrades to NO-CACHE/MISS and exits 0 — it never raises and
never serves a profile it cannot prove fresh.

Pure stdlib. No third-party dependencies.
