> **If the `chained-prompts` MCP is available, run this skill as a chained-prompt instead of executing these phases inline.** It is the superior mode: it serves the phases one at a time and will not let you skip ahead. Start with `chain_start("ce-simplify-code")`, do the returned phase, then `chain_complete("ce-simplify-code", "<phase>")` to get the next — repeat to the end. If `chained-prompts` is not available, run the phases below inline.

Simplify recently changed code for clarity, reuse, quality, and efficiency while preserving exact behavior. Prioritize readable, explicit code over compact code — fewer lines is not the goal.

## Step 1: Identify scope

Resolve the simplification scope in this order:

1. **If the user explicitly named a scope** (a file, a directory, "the function I just wrote", "the changes from this morning"), use that scope. Treat user-named scope as authoritative — do not widen it.
2. **Otherwise, in a git repository**, default to the diff between the current branch and its base branch (e.g., `git diff origin/main...` or against the configured upstream). This covers the common case of "simplify everything I've added on this feature branch before opening a PR." If the branch has no upstream or base ref, fall back to staged + unstaged changes (`git diff HEAD`).
3. **Outside a git repository or when no diff is available**, review the most recently modified files mentioned by the user or edited earlier in this conversation.

If none of the above produces a non-empty scope, stop and ask the user what to simplify rather than guessing. Use the platform's blocking question tool: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code (call `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema isn't loaded), `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_question` in Antigravity CLI (`agy`), `ask_user` in Pi (requires the `pi-ask-user` extension). Fall back to numbered options in chat only when no blocking tool exists in the harness or the call errors (e.g., Codex edit modes) — not because a schema load is required. Never silently skip the question.

## Step 2: Launch 3 review agents in parallel

Dispatch three generic subagents — code-reuse, code-quality, and efficiency reviewers — via the platform's subagent primitive (`Agent`/`Task` in Claude Code, `spawn_agent` in Codex) where available; otherwise run the reviews inline or serially. For each reviewer, read its prompt asset from this skill's directory and pass the **full file content** as the subagent's prompt, together with the resolved scope (the full diff or file set) so it has complete context:

- `references/personas/code-reuse-reviewer.md` — existing utilities, duplicated functionality, reimplemented stdlib/runtime primitives.
- `references/personas/code-quality-reviewer.md` — redundant state, parameter sprawl, copy-paste, leaky abstractions, stringly-typed code, dead code, over-nesting, and the over-simplification balance guard.
- `references/personas/efficiency-reviewer.md` — unnecessary work, missed concurrency, hot-path bloat, no-op updates, memory leaks.

Do not paraphrase these rubrics from memory — read each file and pass it verbatim, or the reviewer loses the gating rules that keep the pass behavior-preserving.

**Bounded dispatch.** Queue the three reviewers and launch only as many as the harness accepts at once; treat a concurrency/active-agent-limit error as backpressure (leave the reviewer queued and retry after a slot frees), not as reviewer failure.

**Model selection.** Use the platform's mid-tier model for these reviewers when the current harness exposes a known override. In Claude Code this is the Sonnet class; in Codex use the current mini/mid-tier model exposed by `spawn_agent` when known. On platforms where the model-override parameter is unavailable or the model name is unknown or unrecognized, omit the override -- a working pass on the parent model beats a broken dispatch.

**Permission mode.** Omit the `mode` parameter on the dispatch call so the user's configured permission settings apply.

## Step 3: Fix issues

Wait for all three agents to complete. Aggregate their findings and fix each issue directly. If a finding is a false positive or not worth addressing, note it and move on. Do not argue with the finding or raise questions to the user, just skip it.

Before applying each fix, confirm it preserves behavior: same output for every input, same error behavior, and same side effects and ordering. If a fix can't clear that test, skip it — automated checks in Step 4 don't cover every behavior.

**Never simplify away a safety check.** Input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security checks (authorization, escaping, sanitization), and accessibility affordances are not removable boilerplate — preserve them even when a finding frames them as redundant or inline-able. Code that drops one of these is not simpler, it is unfinished. If a proposed simplification would thin or remove one, skip it.

## Step 4: Verify behavior is preserved

The premise of this skill is that simplification preserves exact functionality. After applying fixes:

**Run typecheck and lint over the full project.** They are usually fast and catch the most common simplification regressions — broken imports, unused exports, dropped type narrowings, dead code other modules still reference.

**Run tests:**
- Run tests scoped to the changed paths. CI runs the full suite on PR — this local check is a fast signal, not the final guarantee. Match scope to blast radius; a 3-line simplification doesn't warrant a 20-minute test run.
- Broaden scope when the change has obvious wide reach — e.g., a heavily-imported utility was rewritten, or the code-quality reviewer's consolidation/dedup fixes modified shared code. This is a judgment call about ripple risk, not a mechanical rule.
- If the test runner has no scoping mechanism, run the full suite.

Surface any failure clearly with the failing check name and the relevant output. Do not relax assertions, weaken type signatures, or skip tests to make checks pass — that defeats the "preserves functionality" guarantee. Either fix the underlying break introduced by simplification, or revert the specific change that caused the regression.

If no test suite, lint, or typecheck is configured, state that explicitly in the summary; do not silently skip verification.

## Step 5: Summarize

Briefly summarize what was good vs improved and fixed, including which checks were run and their results. If there were no findings to act on, confirm the code didn't require any changes.

**Quantify the impact by dimension.** Report what was actually applied, not a line count: fixes applied per reviewer dimension (reuse, quality, efficiency), how many findings were skipped as false-positive or not worth addressing, and the behavior-preservation result (checks run and outcome). For example: "Applied 6 — reuse 2, quality 3, efficiency 1; skipped 2 false positives; typecheck + lint clean, 11 scoped tests pass." Do not headline a net-lines-removed figure or frame fewer lines as the win — many clarity, safety, and efficiency fixes preserve or add lines. The measure is what improved and that behavior held, not how much code shrank.
