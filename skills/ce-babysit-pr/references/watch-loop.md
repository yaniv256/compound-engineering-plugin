# Watch loop — scheduling, state, dedup, edge cases

Read this once per babysit session, before acting on the first tick's output. It defines *how ticks are scheduled per harness*, the *on-disk state contract*, the *claim→act→confirm dedup protocol* that makes ticks idempotent and crash-safe, and the *edge-case handling*. SKILL.md owns the ordering invariant; this file owns the mechanics.

## How the watch sustains itself

A skill's turn ends when it returns, so *the skill sets up its own loop* — nothing re-invokes it by magic. The robust, cross-harness-verified way is **not** to call a specific per-harness scheduler; it is to run a cheap deterministic background change-detector and **stay in-session**, woken when it signals:

- **`pr-snapshot watch`** is that detector — same fetch→diff on an interval, **no agent tokens**, prints one `BABYSIT_WAKE {reason,url,...}` line *only* on work to inspect (`actionable` for unresolved threads or failed CI; `feedback-candidate` for non-thread content awaiting resolver judgment) or a stop condition (`terminal` / `blocked-external` / `blocked-failing` — a dispatched check left terminally red — / `needs-human` / `merge-ready` after settle / `max-runtime` / `stop-signal`), then exits. A `feedback-candidate` that the resolver silent-drops is a normal classification outcome, not a detector false positive.
- The agent **backgrounds `watch` and waits for that line** with its harness's *background-and-wake* capability, runs a tick, and re-arms. The loop lives **in the current session**, so it keeps every decision the conversation made — declined nits, a reviewer judged wrong, the user's mid-run steering — and spends reasoning only when something changed.

The needed capability is generic — *run a background process and be woken when it emits a line, without ending the turn* — so **describe the capability and use whatever tool the harness has**, rather than hardcoding a scheduler. A skill drives **tool calls**, never user-typed slash commands. Known instances (examples, not a required list; verified live this session):

| Harness | Background-and-wake tool the agent uses | Durable beyond the session? |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Claude Code (CLI) | background `Bash` + a `Monitor`/wait; or `ScheduleWakeup` under `/loop` | No (session-bound) — cron for durable |
| Grok (CLI/TUI) | background `run_terminal_command` + `get_command_or_subagent_output`; `scheduler_create --durable` for a cross-session schedule | Yes via `scheduler_create --durable` (60s min, 7d) |
| Cursor (CLI) | `Shell` background + `notify_on_output` sentinel (its `/loop` is user-typed, **not** skill-invocable) | No (session-bound) |
| Codex (CLI) | a runtime-owned background exec that re-runs the tick (a detached `nohup` is **reaped** when the tool call ends) | No (session-bound) |
| GUI apps / headless / unknown | none reliable → **checkpoint** | — |

**Checkpoint (the floor):** when no background-and-wake capability exists, run one tick, persist, report, and print the exact re-run command (`/ce-babysit-pr <PR-url>`) — monitoring is *paused*, say so plainly. Because every tick is disk-resumable, checkpoint is the same loop hand-cranked; the in-session watch only automates the crank. Never fake a loop with a foreground `sleep` (blocked on Claude Code, discouraged elsewhere) or a detached `nohup` (reaped/unsupported on several harnesses).

**Durability:** the in-session watch dies with the session; re-invoking resumes from disk (`/tmp` persists across ticks). For an unattended multi-day watch, escalate to a durable scheduler (Grok `scheduler_create --durable`, or cron running `<cli> exec "/ce-babysit-pr <url>"`) — a fresh headless run is context-blind, so persist consequential decisions to disk. **Shell env vars do not persist between separate tool calls** on any harness — re-set `SKILL_DIR`/`STATE_DIR` inline in every command.

## Cadence (the watch interval)

- `pr-snapshot watch --interval` is the poll cadence: ~2-3 min while active; widen to ~5-10 min when quiet — the detector is cheap, but each poll is a `gh` call, so respect rate limits.
- `--settle-seconds` (default 300) is the quiet window before a `merge-ready` wake, so the agent is roused to declare-ready only once the PR has actually cooled off, not every poll. Leave it unset on the normal arm — the script's default is the initial policy; the only invocation that sets it is the post-rejection re-arm in SKILL.md Step 3's merge-ready wake protocol.
- A push/mutation moves the head — re-arm `watch` (active cadence) so it reads the new state.
- Honor GitHub rate-limit reset headers; back off on `403`/`429`.
- After any mutation, re-snapshot at the *start of the next tick*, not mid-tick.

## Pipeline mode bound (`mode:pipeline`)

An orchestrator (`lfg`) drives ticks in-line and needs the loop to terminate. Run ticks back-to-back until the stop below. **To wait for CI to progress between ticks, use the harness's native non-blocking wait — never a bare foreground `sleep`** (blocked on Claude Code, discouraged elsewhere): Claude Code's `Monitor` until-loop; Grok's `get_command_or_subagent_output(timeout_ms=…)` or a `monitor`; Cursor's `Await` on a backgrounded `gh pr checks --watch`. If the harness has no non-blocking wait, do one tick and return control to the orchestrator rather than busy-spinning. Loop until:

- **CI is clean** (`all_checks_ok` — every check terminal, **none failing**, and at least one observed) **and** the actionable backlog is empty — success. A terminal-but-**red** check `ce-debug` left as a residual (`has_failing_checks` true) or an empty rollup (`checks_present` false — Actions has not created check-runs yet, not that CI passed) is **not** success: keep ticking until they clear/materialize or the time budget expires, then return with residuals or `no-checks-observed`; or
- a **budget** is hit: default **3 CI fix rounds** per head-lineage (mirrors `lfg`'s historical cap) and an overall time cap (~30-45 min). On budget-exhaust, the still-red checks and any `needs-human` items become residuals.

Never wait on the merge-ready settle window or human review in pipeline mode — those are interactive stops. A check stuck `IN_PROGRESS` past the time cap ends the run with a "CI still running" residual rather than blocking forever.

The round/time budget above is a **blunt cost floor**, not a convergence detector — it catches a runaway that never trips the trajectory-driven stop below. Prefer to stop *because it's demonstrably not converging*, not because a timer expired.

## Non-convergence (trigger → route → park → re-open)

A loop can churn without finishing: CI **ping-pong** (fix A surfaces B, fix B brings A back — often an emergent trade-off), a review-bot **treadmill** (each commit spawns fresh nits), or **wrong-approach whack-a-mole** (each nit is valid but the approach, e.g. a regex, is the problem). A raw attempt counter can't tell these from *legitimate progress* (four independent failures each fixed once) — so the decision is **agent reasoning over the trajectory**, and the split is strict:

- **`pr-snapshot` (babysit) ships facts.** The `trajectory` block is deterministic and coarse: `check_recur_max`/`recurring_checks` (a check that failed → cleared → failed again on a *new* head; same-head flapping is excluded, so this is not flaky noise), `unresolved_trend` + `new_threads_this_tick` (backlog growing / fresh threads arriving), `stream_alternations` (ci↔review bouncing — cross-stream churn only babysit can see), `heads_since_progress` (heads moved without a new low in open problems). Babysit **never** labels this "non-convergence."
- **The leaf judges.** When a trigger fires (the thresholds are in SKILL.md Step 2 — the single source of truth; do not re-list them here), pass the trajectory into that tick's `ce-debug`/`ce-resolve-pr-feedback` as **mandatory input**. It must either demonstrate progress (name the invariant the next bounded fix resolves) or return a `needs-human` that **parks the whole stream** with a `decision_context` (the tension/root, options, tradeoffs, its lean).

**The anti-cry-wolf line (put it to the leaf):** *progressive failure migration* — A fixed → B appears once → B fixed → done — is ordinary repair; **do not park.** *Oscillation* — A returns after B's fix, the failing set cycles, defects migrate X→Y→Z with the same invariant unsatisfied, or fix size grows superlinearly — is non-convergence; park. "We've tried a lot" is never enough.

**A third case the counter must not miss: a *correct* finding recurring across sibling sites.** When each new head brings a fresh thread that is *valid* and shares one root and treatment with an already-fixed one — not a wrong-approach cluster, not oscillation — the problem is a single fix with a multi-site blast radius surfacing one site per head; dripping it one-per-head is as wasteful as parking it is wrong. **Route it, don't decide it here:** pass the recurring feedback cluster **plus** the trajectory to `ce-resolve-pr-feedback` and request a **bounded-class assessment**. The resolver holds the diff and owns the call — it decides whether the sites are genuinely equivalent (same invariant, same fix, only behavior this PR touched), enumerates the concrete locations, and fixes the class in one pass. Babysit does **not** infer the root or the sites from the `trajectory` — those are churn counts, not semantic identity. If the resolver judges the sites *not* equivalent, it falls back to per-site; if it judges the shared root a wrong approach, it parks — unchanged from above.

**Guards:**

- **Moving-target ≠ non-convergence.** Base-branch merges, dep bumps, flaky infra, and bot-rule changes create unrelated new failures. Recurrence already excludes same-SHA flapping; still, don't park a failure the leaf attributes to an external cause rather than the approach.
- **Cross-stream contradiction.** If `ce-debug` concludes the review-requested behavior is invalid while `ce-resolve-pr-feedback` concludes it's required, that's a single **cross-stream** residual — don't arbitrarily park one side.
- **Parked = hard blocker, re-openable.** A parked stream makes the PR *not* merge-ready (never "done"), but re-open it on material change (a human pushed a new head, the parked thread was superseded/resolved, or the failing-check universe changed). **How:** CI re-opens itself — a new head SHA clears the SHA-scoped dispatch state, so just re-snapshot. A parked **review thread** does *not* auto-re-open; `mark --thread <id> --disposition open` re-actionizes it for a fresh pass. Un-park deliberately, on judged material change — not on the resolver's own reply.

## On-disk state contract

State lives at `/tmp/compound-engineering/ce-babysit-pr/<host>-<owner>-<repo>-<pr>/state.json` (a stable, cross-invocation-reusable path so any later tick — scheduled or hand-run — finds it). The `<host>` segment (from the PR URL, `github.com` on the public host) is load-bearing for GitHub Enterprise: without it, two PRs sharing `owner/repo#N` on different hosts would reuse one `state.json` and cross-contaminate dispositions. The `pr-snapshot` script owns all reads and writes under a file lock. Shape:

```json
{
  "pr": { "owner": "...", "repo": "...", "number": 123, "url": "..." },
  "head_sha": "abc123",
  "tick": 7,
  "started_at": "<iso8601>",
  "checks": { "<check_key>": { "name": "...", "status": "COMPLETED", "conclusion": "FAILURE", "head_sha": "abc123" } },
  "threads": { "<thread_id>": { "last_comment_id": "...", "last_comment_at": "<iso8601>", "disposition": "open|dispatched|needs-human", "acted_identity": ["<comment_id>", "<comment_at>"] } },
  "feedback": { "<comment_or_review_id>": { "kind": "comment|review", "author": "...", "disposition": "open|dispatched|needs-human" } },
  "ci_dispatched": { "<head_sha>": ["<check_key>", "..."] },
  "review_decision": "APPROVED",
  "mergeable": "MERGEABLE",
  "merge_state_status": "CLEAN",
  "last_change_at": "<iso8601>",
  "last_action": "<short string>",
  "trajectory": {
    "check_history": { "<check_key>": { "state": "failing|clear", "last_head": "abc123", "recur": 0 } },
    "seen_threads": { "<thread_id>": 3 },
    "unresolved_series": [2, 3, 4],
    "stream_series": ["ci", "review", "ci"],
    "min_open_problems": 1,
    "heads_since_progress": 0
  }
}
```

A `check_key` is `"<workflow>/<name>"` (or `"<name>"` when there is no workflow) — stable across polls for the same head, which is all the dedup needs (see below). Each `snapshot` emits `changed_this_tick`, `quiet_seconds`, `session_seconds`, and the derived `trajectory` facts (see **Non-convergence** above). The `trajectory` sub-state is deterministic bookkeeping the script maintains; the leaves reason over the emitted facts.

## Claim → act → confirm (the dedup protocol)

The rule that makes ticks idempotent *and* crash-safe: **the snapshot never marks an item handled just from observing it.** An item leaves the actionable set only when the agent confirms it acted (via `mark`) or when remote truth removes it. So if a resolve/debug pass crashes, errors, or returns without finishing, the item is still actionable on the next tick — the loop cannot silently drop work.

- **Review threads.** A thread is actionable while it is unresolved and you have not recorded acting on it. After a resolve pass, `mark --thread <id> --disposition dispatched` (handled) or `--disposition needs-human` (escalated) silences it. A later fetch drops resolved threads entirely (remote confirms the resolve). A **`dispatched`** thread that is still unresolved is **reactivated** when a later reviewer comment moves its last-comment identity past `acted_identity` — the identity captured on the first tick we saw it dispatched, which is *after* our own reply landed, so our reply is the baseline and does not re-trigger while a genuine reviewer re-engagement does. A **`needs-human`** thread stays parked — blocking merge-ready via `open_needs_human` — until **a human answers it**: a reviewer reply or a top-level-comment edit moves its identity past the `decision_context` reply we captured as the baseline, which auto-reopens and wakes it (our own reply is the baseline, so it never self-triggers); an explicit `--disposition open` still forces it too. This closes two failure modes: a dispatched-but-unresolved thread with fresh reviewer activity would otherwise vanish from `counts.threads` and let the merge-ready gate call the PR ready, and a parked question the human *answered* would otherwise sit ignored forever while the watch stayed idle.
- **Non-thread feedback candidates** (top-level PR comments + review-submission bodies). Surfaced as `actionable.comments` for content that has **no inline thread** — a Changes-Requested review summary or a bare top-level "please rename X". The field name supports the shared claim→act→confirm protocol; it does not mean the detector has semantically proven that the body requires work. A comments-only watch emits `feedback-candidate`, and a resolver pass that silent-drops it is a normal classification outcome. The deterministic fetch excludes only empty bodies and messages known to be from the PR author; those are structural loop-prevention facts. It never classifies external feedback by content, bot identity, or comment-vs-review surface: those are semantic signals for `ce-resolve` to judge, and bot formats, identities, and posting surfaces can change. Unlike a thread there is **no remote resolve**, so a surfaced item never drops out of the fetch on its own: `mark --comment <id> --disposition dispatched` (handled or judged non-actionable) or `--disposition needs-human` (escalated) is the *only* thing that silences it. Same open/dispatched/needs-human dispositions and explicit re-open (`--disposition open`) as threads. A `dispatched` item reactivates when its own body is **edited** to add a request (tracked by an `edit_id` body hash, since `gh pr view` exposes no `updatedAt`) — a *new* comment is simply a new id, and our reply is a separate top-level comment that never edits the original, so it does not retrigger. Both streams count as one **review** stream for the trajectory (a bot re-posting fresh top-level nits every commit is a treadmill, not silence) and for the merge-ready backlog (`counts.threads` **and** `counts.comments` must both be 0).
- **CI checks.** A failing check on the current head is actionable until you `mark --check <key>` (recorded in `ci_dispatched[head_sha]`). A new head SHA clears `ci_dispatched` and re-evaluates every check against the new commit, so green is never carried across a push. There is no transition-tracking: a failing check simply stays actionable until you record acting on it, which is both simpler and immune to missing an `IN_PROGRESS → FAILURE` edge between polls.

`ci_dispatched`, the thread dispositions, and the feedback dispositions **are** the journal — they are written by `mark` and read by `snapshot`. There is no separate crash-recovery record because an un-`mark`ed item is, by construction, still actionable.

## Merge-readiness and the settle window

Do not re-derive "required checks" — GitHub already computes it. Use `mergeable == "MERGEABLE"` and `merge_state_status == "CLEAN"` (branch protection satisfied: required checks green, required review approved, no conflicts). `UNSTABLE` means mergeable but a non-required check is red; `BLOCKED` means a required gate is unmet. The snapshot also emits `has_failing_checks` so you can act on a red check even while `merge_state_status` is `UNSTABLE`.

The settle window guards the most damaging false positive: "CI went green, told the user to merge, then feedback landed."

- The script stamps `last_change_at` whenever anything observable moves — a check status/conclusion, a thread's identity (added, edited, or resolved-away), the head SHA, `review_decision`, `mergeable`, or `merge_state_status`. Each snapshot emits `quiet_seconds`.
- "Looks ready" requires `quiet_seconds >= 300` (default) on top of a CLEAN mergeable state and zero actionable backlog (threads **and** non-thread feedback). A reviewer or bot still working shows up as recent activity → `quiet_seconds` resets.
- **It is a cooling-off signal, not a guarantee.** Five quiet minutes is evidence the PR stopped moving, not proof no review is coming. Report "looks ready — your call," never "safe to merge." This is why the settle window, not per-bot signal parsing, is the primary guard: it is robust to reviewers you have never seen, and most in-progress activity already resets the clock for free.

## Concurrency

- **Lock.** The script takes a file lock around each state read/write. It cannot span the agent's mutations (which happen between script calls), so it is necessary but not sufficient.
- **Pre-mutation revalidation.** The delegated skills re-check remote before they write, but a second babysitter or a human can still act between your snapshot and your action. Treat the snapshot as a hint, never as a guarantee the world is unchanged at mutation time.

## Edge cases

- **Behind base** (`merge_state_status == "BEHIND"`): when the repo requires up-to-date branches (or the base moved materially), `gh pr update-branch` — a **merge of base into head**, never a rebase. It re-triggers CI + review, so at most once per tick and only when it unblocks merge.
- **Merge conflict mid-flight** (`mergeable == "CONFLICTING"`): merge base into head locally and split like the fix-authority boundary — **mechanical** conflicts (lockfiles, changelog/generated files, non-overlapping additions) resolve + commit + push; a **semantic** conflict (both sides changed the same logic, so resolving decides intended behavior) aborts the merge and surfaces as `needs-human` with `decision_context`. **Never rebase or force-push** — rewriting a PR head branch is destructive; a base-into-head merge is the only safe mechanism.
- **External head change / force-push:** the head SHA moved under the loop. The snapshot clears SHA-scoped CI state automatically; just re-snapshot. Never clobber unrelated pushed work.
- **PR closed or merged externally:** detected as `pr_state != "OPEN"` on any tick → clean exit with a final status.
- **needs-human feedback:** `ce-resolve-pr-feedback` leaves those threads open and returns them as escalations; record each with `mark ... --disposition needs-human`, keep doing independent CI work, and surface them. Never auto-decline or auto-resolve a thread you did not fix. A parked `needs-human` is a **standing residual** (SKILL.md Step 3): it blocks *declaring* merge-ready but does **not** end the watch — keep handling new CI and later review rounds around it. Only a true stop (terminal / looks-ready / the budget cap) ends the loop, not a count of accumulated escalations.
- **No push access / fork PR:** a delegated push will fail. Detect that from the delegated skill's result, report it, and stop — the loop cannot make progress it has no permission to make.
- **CI that never completes:** a check stuck `IN_PROGRESS` for a long time will keep the loop from settling. When the session budget (`session_seconds` cap) is reached, hand back with "CI still running after <N>" rather than looping forever.
- **Rate limits / transient API errors:** honor the reset time, back off, resume. The claim→confirm protocol protects against replay.
