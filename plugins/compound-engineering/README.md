# Compounding Engineering Plugin

AI-powered development tools that get smarter with every use. Make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Getting Started

After installing, run `/ce-setup` in any project. It diagnoses your environment, installs missing tools, and bootstraps project config in one interactive flow.

## Components

| Component | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Agents | 50+ |
| Skills | 38+ |

## Skills

The primary entry points for engineering work, invoked as slash commands. Detailed user-facing documentation for many skills lives in [`docs/skills/`](../../docs/skills/) — each linked skill name below points to its page (purpose, novel mechanics, use cases, chain position). Skills without dedicated docs are still listed; their `SKILL.md` in the source tree is authoritative.

### Core Workflow

`ce-strategy` anchors the loop upstream; `ce-product-pulse` closes it with a read on user outcomes.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`/ce-strategy`](../../docs/skills/ce-strategy.md) | Create or maintain `STRATEGY.md` — the product's target problem, approach, persona, key metrics, and tracks. Re-runnable to update. Read as grounding by `/ce-ideate`, `/ce-brainstorm`, and `/ce-plan` when present |
| [`/ce-ideate`](../../docs/skills/ce-ideate.md) | Optional big-picture ideation: generate and critically evaluate grounded ideas, then route the strongest one into brainstorming |
| [`/ce-brainstorm`](../../docs/skills/ce-brainstorm.md) | Interactive Q&A to think through a feature or problem and write a right-sized requirements doc before planning |
| [`/ce-plan`](../../docs/skills/ce-plan.md) | Create structured plans for any multi-step task -- software features, research workflows, events, study plans -- with automatic confidence checking |
| [`/ce-code-review`](../../docs/skills/ce-code-review.md) | Structured code review with tiered persona agents, confidence gating, and dedup pipeline |
| [`/ce-work`](../../docs/skills/ce-work.md) | Execute work items systematically |
| [`/ce-debug`](../../docs/skills/ce-debug.md) | Systematically find root causes and fix bugs -- traces causal chains, forms testable hypotheses, and implements test-first fixes |
| [`/ce-compound`](../../docs/skills/ce-compound.md) | Document solved problems to compound team knowledge |
| [`/ce-compound-refresh`](../../docs/skills/ce-compound-refresh.md) | Refresh stale or drifting learnings and decide whether to keep, update, replace, or archive them |

| [`/ce-product-pulse`](../../docs/skills/ce-product-pulse.md) | Generate a single-page, time-windowed report on usage, performance, errors, and followups. Saves reports to `docs/pulse-reports/` as a browseable timeline of what users experienced |
